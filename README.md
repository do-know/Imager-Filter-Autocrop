# Imager::Filter::Autocrop - Automatic crop filter for Imager.

This module extends Imager functionality with the autocrop filter, similar to
ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick "trim". It does have a few additional features
as well, such as support for the border or detection-only mode. The command-line
script **autocrop.pl** is also provided.

### COMPATIBILITY

The module should run fine on both Lunux and Windows platforms (under ActiveState Perl
and Strawberry Perl) with Imager versions 0.91 and up. It could work on older versions too (from 0.48 and up), but that has not been tested.

### INSTALLATION

**With CPANminus**

    cpanm Imager::Filter::Autocrop
    
**With CPAN**

    cpan -i Imager::Filter::Autocrop
    
**Manual installation**:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

### USAGE

```perl
 use Imager;
 use Imager::Filter::Autocrop;

 my $img = Imager->new();
 $img->read(file => 'image.jpg');
 $img->filter(type => 'autocrop') or die $img->errstr;
```

### NAME OVERRIDE

You can change the name under which the filter is registered, by specifying it in 'use' directive.
For example, to change the name to 'trim' from the default 'autocrop':

```perl
 use Imager;
 use Imager::Filter::Autocrop 'trim';

 $img->filter(type => 'trim') or die $img->errstr;
```

### PARAMETERS

Additional parameters to use in 'filter' call:

| Name          | Type | Default | Usage  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| -----|
| color     | Str/Obj | - | By default the color of the top left pixel is used for cropping. You can explicitly specify one though, by either providing the '#RRGGBB' value or passing an object of 'Imager::Color' class or its subclass. |
| fuzz      | Int     | 0 | You can specify the deviation for the color value (for all RGB channels or the main channel if it is a greyscale image), by using the 'fuzz' parameter. All image colors within the range would be treated as matching candidates for cropping. |
| border    | Int     | 0 | You can specify the border around the image for cropping. If the cropping area with the border is identical to the original image height and width, then no actual cropping will be done. |
| detect    | HashRef | - | Finally, you can just detect the cropping area by passing a hash reference as a 'detect' parameter. On success, your hash will be set with 'left', 'right', 'top' and 'bottom' keys and appropriate values. Please note that if the 'border' parameter is used, the detected area values will be adjusted appropriately. |

**Note:** If the image looks blank (whether genuinely or because of the 'fuzz' parameter), or if there is nothing to crop, then the filter call will
return false and the 'errstr' method will return appropriate message.
